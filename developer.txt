# developer.txt – INSPIRE STARFIELD NAVIGATOR

## High-level Goal

Build a **night-sky star chart web app** called **INSPIRE Starfield Navigator** that:

- Shows an animated view of the night sky above the user based on their location and time.
- Lets users:
  - Use geolocation or manually set their location.
  - Scrub through time (past / future) to see sky changes.
  - Tap/click on stars and objects to open a **collapsible/expandable info panel**.
- Each object has:
  - A custom image (or stylized illustration).
  - Scientific facts.
  - Cultural + INSPIRE-style lore.
- Works well on **mobile and desktop**, and can be embedded into my Shopify site (Dawn theme) at https://www.inspireclothing.art.

This is an **artistic + educational** tool, not a professional-grade observatory app. Accuracy should be “good enough” for everyday stargazing and learning.

## Brand / Vibe

- Name: **INSPIRE Starfield Navigator**
- Vibe: Guerrilla astronomer / hacker-druid / street stargazer.
- Visual style:
  - Dark cosmic background (deep navy/black).
  - Neon accents (electric purple, teal, magenta).
  - Clean but bold typography (Google Fonts, e.g. a display font for headings + a legible sans for body).
- Tone of copy:
  - Inspirational, slightly mischievous, grounded in science but open to myth.
  - Example line: “You’re looking at photons that left before your great-grandparents were born.”

## Tech Stack & Deliverables

**Tech:** Browser-only, no backend required.

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no build step).
- Use `<canvas>` or SVG for starfield rendering.
- You MAY use lightweight libraries via CDN if they help:
  - `three.js` or a 2D canvas-based approach for the sky.
  - A simple utility library is fine (e.g. tiny slider, but avoid bloated frameworks).

**Deliverables:**

1. `index.html`
2. `styles.css`
3. `script.js`
4. Optional: `objects.json` (if you keep star/celestial catalog in a separate file; otherwise embed as a JS constant).

## Embedding Requirements

App should be self-contained and embeddable:

- Root container:

  ```html
  <div id="inspire-starfield-app"></div>
